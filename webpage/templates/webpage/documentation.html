    <h3>Team</h3>
    <p>This project is a collaboration between Peter Andorfer and Ksenia Zaytseva of the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH, Vienna) and Greta Franzini of the UCL Centre for Digital Humanities (UCLDH, London). Peter and Ksenia develop the web application while Greta curates the data.</p>

    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <p>The <em>Catalogue of Digital Editions</em> began collecting digital editions in 2012. Development on the web application began in the summer of 2016 and kick-started the collaboration. The project will continue as long as the team's means allow.</p>

    <h3>Components and repositories</h3>
    <p>The <em>Catalogue of Digital Editions Web Application</em> is made-up of two interacting components, each stored in its own GitHub repository: 1) the data, and 2) the web application to display the data to the user. The two components are connected via a custom script that regularly fetches the latest updates from the data repository and delivers them to the web application.</p>

    <h4>Data</h4>
    <p>The data is collected across two <code>.csv</code> (Comma Separated Value) files: the "master" file contains the digital editions, while the second file contains geographical information associated with the institutions mentioned in the master file (including <a href="http://www.dnb.de/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">DNB</a> and <a href="http://www.geonames.org/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">GeoNames</a> IDs). This second file allows us to place digital editions on a map.</p>
    <p>The data's GitHub repository is: <a href=="https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat</a></p>


    <h4>Web application</h4>
    <p>The application is a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">Django web framework</a> designed to be simple and pragmatic.</p> 
    <p>Some fields in the <em>Catalogue</em>'s data file contain decimal numbers as values to measure the degree of compliance of a project to a particular feature: 0 stands for 'no compliance', 0.5 for 'somewhat/partially compliant', 1 for 'fully compliant'. Numbers make it easier to run calculations and statistical analyses over the data-set. When fetching data updates, the web application transforms these values into human-readable information: 0 becomes 'no', 0.5 becomes 'partial/somewhat' and 1 becomes 'yes'.</p>
    <p>The web application's default view of the <em>Catalogue</em> data is a searchable table, but it also provides bar and pie charts to better visualise statistical information.</p>
    <p>The web application's GitHub repository is: <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dig_ed_cat" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dig_ed_cat</a></p>


    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <p>As of early 2017, the web application is still in its beta phase and despite a few bugs we're making good progress on both data accuracy and front/back-end development.</p>


    <h3>How to contribute to the <em>Catalogue</em></h3>
    <p>If you wish to contribute a digital edition to the <em>Catalogue</em> or correct an existing entry, you can do so in one of three ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're familiar with GitHub, you can fork <a href="https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">the data repository</a>, edit the <code>.csv</code> file and create a pull request.</li>
        <li>If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can create <a href="https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat/issues" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">a GitHub issue</a> with as much information about the edition as possible (see 'Data fields' <a href="https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat/wiki/Data-description-&-contribution#data-fields-in-the-catalogue" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">here</a>). The more information you provide, the sooner the edition will appear in the <em>Catalogue</em>.</li>
        <li>If you'd rather not use GitHub at all, you can fill-in a Google Form at this address: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4Ya3jwRCBi0VSexx2" title="Opens in new tab" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/forms/4Ya3jwRCBi0VSexx2</a> Your entry will be moderated and promptly added to the <em>Catalogue</em>.</li>
    </ul>
