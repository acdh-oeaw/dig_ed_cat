    <p class="text-justify">Since 2012 <strong><a href="https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat/wiki">Greta Franzini's Catalogue of Digital Editions</a></strong> has been gathering digital editions in an attempt to survey and identify best practice in the field of digital scholarly editing. Other cataloguing initiatives do not provide the granular analysis of features necessary to understand the rationale and methodology behind the creation of an edition. The Catalogue is useful as it provides an accessible record of standards and building tools used, and thus an insight into past, present and future projects. For data-related questions, please contact <a href="http://www.gretafranzini.com/">Greta Franzini</a>.</p>
    <P class="text-justify">This web application was developed to deliver the Catalogue data to users in an interactive and user-friendly manner, allowing them to browse, search, filter and order the projects around their research interests. Should you have any questions, comments or feedback, do not hesitate to get in touch with the developers <a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/en/andorfer">Peter Andorfer</a> and <a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/en/zaytseva">Ksenia Zaytseva</a> or visit the application's <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dig_ed_cat">GitHub Repository.</p>
