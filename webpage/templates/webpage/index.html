    <p class="text-justify">Since 2012 <strong><a href="https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat/wiki">Greta Franzini's Catalogue of Digital Editions</a></strong> has been gathering digital editions in an attempt to survey and identify best practice in the field of digital scholarly editing. Other cataloguing initiatives do not provide the granular analysis of features necessary to understand the rationale and methodology behind the creation of an edition. The Catalogue is useful as it provides an accessible record of standards and building tools used, and thus an insight into past and present projects. For data-related questions, please contact <a href="http://www.gretafranzini.com/">Greta Franzini</a>. <strong>For instructions on how to contribute digital editions to the Catalogue, please visit this <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat/wiki/Data-description-&-contribution#how-to-contribute-a-digital-edition-to-the-catalogue">page</a></strong>.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">This web application was developed to deliver the Catalogue data to users in an interactive and user-friendly manner, allowing them to browse, search, filter and order the projects around their research interests. Should you have any questions, comments or feedback, do not hesitate to get in touch with the developers <a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/en/andorfer">Peter Andorfer</a> and <a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/en/zaytseva">Ksenia Zaytseva</a> or visit the application's <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dig_ed_cat">GitHub Repository.</a></p>
    <p>In 2017, the Catalogue of Digital Editions won third place in the <a href="http://dhawards.org/dhawards2016/results/">DH Awards 2016 Best DH Data Visualization category</a>.</p>
    <span class="text-muted">Please note this is a beta version of application.</span>
